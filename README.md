# Project Plan
Full-stack web application for a seafood restaurant. Creating a front end design with a minimilistic design using only one page with hyperlinks to scroll to specific sections. Included will be a reservation system with a back-end to keep track of dates, times, party-size, and other necessary information. The Back-End will be developed using FastAPI in the python programming language. Using the MySQL connector, the program will create a reservation system database to store information.
