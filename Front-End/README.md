Full stack application with a reservation system API.

Front-end:
  React based front end with a UI/UX designed in Figma by myself. Used the npm react-scroll library for smooth scrolling and using npm react-google-maps for about section with map component. Used plain CSS and flex for positioning and styling.

Back-end:
  Planning on using Express.js and MySQL to create a relational database of reservations and dates.
